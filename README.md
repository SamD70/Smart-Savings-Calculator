#Smart Savings Calculator

Introduction

I built this application as a means for people to be able to track their income (before tax) and expenses
in order to see how much they are able to save monthly. I used JavaScript to allow my app to calculate the 
tax spent on income and allow for pension and student loan contributions. This coupled with users inputing 
their monthly expenses allowed me to calculate their savings.
